# What is Distributed Chaos?

Distributed Chaos (DC) is a grassroots movement focused on creating and nurturing local hacker communities without bureaucratic overhead. We believe in the power of decentralized, self-organizing groups that foster innovation, learning, and collaboration in technology.

## Core Principles

1. **Decentralization**: There is no central authority. Each group operates independently while sharing knowledge and resources with the broader community.

2. **Open Access**: Knowledge should be freely shared. We encourage documentation, open-source projects, and transparent communication.

3. **DIY Ethics**: Embrace the hacker spirit of learning by doing, experimenting, and building.

4. **Inclusive Communities**: Welcome all skill levels and backgrounds. Focus on mentorship and knowledge exchange.

5. **Minimal Structure**: Keep organizational overhead low. Focus on doing rather than planning.
